### âœ… Part 2 â€“ Types and Operations

#### ðŸ§ª Exercise 1 â€“ The Basics

> Experiment interactively with the common type operations found in the various operation tables in this part of the book. To get started, bring up the Python interactive interpreter, type each of the following expressions, and try to explain whatâ€™s happening in each case.

#### ðŸ§ª Exercise 2 â€“ Indexing and Slicing

> At the interactive prompt, define a list named L that contains four strings or numbers (e.g., L=[0,1,2,3]). Then, experiment with the following boundary cases.

> What happens when you try to index out of bounds (e.g., L[4])?

> What about slicing out of bounds (e.g., L[âˆ’1000:100])?

> Finally, how does Python handle it if you try to extract a sequence in reverse,
with the lower bound greater than the higher bound (e.g., L[3:1])? 

> Hint: try assigning to this slice (L[3:1]=['?']), and see where the value is put. Do you
think this may be the same phenomenon you saw when slicing out of bounds?

**Solution:**
**File:** `ex2indexing_and_slicing.py`

#### ðŸ§ª Exercise 3 â€“ Indexing Slicing and Del

> Define another list L with four items, and assign an empty
list to one of its offsets (e.g., L[2]=[]). . What happens? 

> Then, assign an empty list to a slice (L[2:3]=[]). What happens now?

> The del statement deletes offsets, keys, attributes, and names. Use it on your list to delete an item (e.g., del L[0]). What happens if you delete an entire slice (del L[1:])?

> What happens when you assign a nonsequence to a slice (L[1:2]=1)?

**File:** `ex3indexing_slicing_del.py`

#### ðŸ§ª Exercise 4 â€“ Tuple Assignment

> Type the following lines:

```bash
% python
X = 'spam'
Y = 'eggs'
X, Y = Y, X
```

> What do you think is happening to X and Y when you type this sequence?

**Solution:**
**File:** `ex4tuple_assignment.py`

#### ðŸ§ª Exercise 5 â€“ Dictionary keys

> Consider the following code fragments:

```bash
D = {}
D[1] = 'a'
D[2] = 'b'
```

> Youâ€™ve learned that dictionaries arenâ€™t accessed by offsets, so whatâ€™s going on here?

> Does the following shed any light on the subject?

```bash
D[(1,2,3)] = 'c'
```

> Strings, integers, and tuples share which type category?

**Solution:**
**File:** `ex5dictionary_keys.py`

#### ðŸ§ª Exercise 6 â€“ Dictionary Indexing

> Create a dictionary named D with three entries, for keys 'a', 'b', and 'c'. What happens if you try to index a nonexistent key (D['d'])?

> What does Python do if you try to assign to a nonexistent key 'd' (e.g., D['d']='spam')?

> How does this compare to out-of-bounds assignments and references for lists?

> Does this sound like the rule for variable names?
