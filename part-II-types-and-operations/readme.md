### âœ… Part 2 â€“ Types and Operations

#### ðŸ§ª Exercise 1 â€“ The Basics

> Experiment interactively with the common type operations found in the various operation tables in this part of the book. To get started, bring up the Python interactive interpreter, type each of the following expressions, and try to explain whatâ€™s happening in each case.

#### ðŸ§ª Exercise 2 â€“ Indexing and Slicing

> . At the interactive prompt, define a list named L that contains four strings or numbers (e.g., L=[0,1,2,3]). Then, experiment with the following boundary cases.

a. What happens when you try to index out of bounds (e.g., L[4])?

b. What about slicing out of bounds (e.g., L[âˆ’1000:100])?

c. Finally, how does Python handle it if you try to extract a sequence in reverse,
with the lower bound greater than the higher bound (e.g., L[3:1])? Hint: try
assigning to this slice (L[3:1]=['?']), and see where the value is put. Do you
think this may be the same phenomenon you saw when slicing out of bounds?
